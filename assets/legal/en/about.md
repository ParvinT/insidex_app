## Next-Generation Wellness

InsideX is a next-generation wellness app that combines HypnoTrack programming, neuroscience, and sound therapy to help you restore balance, confidence, and vitality in daily life.

## What We Offer

We offer personalized sound sessions for sleep, relaxation, fitness, driving, work, meditation, focus, emotional healing, and more. Each session uses affirmations embedded below the threshold of conscious perception — allowing your subconscious mind to absorb positive change naturally and gently.

- Relaxing tracks for deep rest and emotional reset
- Active tracks for workouts, driving, and high-focus tasks
- Healing programs designed for daily progress with measurable results
