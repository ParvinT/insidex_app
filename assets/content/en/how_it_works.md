# HOW DOES THIS ANALYSIS WORK?

This is not an ordinary test — it's a personalized analysis system that delves deep into your subconscious.

## STEP BY STEP PROCESS

**1. Select Your Conditions**
You select the conditions that affect you physically or emotionally. Each selection forms a piece of your subconscious map.

**2. Root Cause Analysis**
Our system reveals the subconscious patterns and emotional roots behind each condition you select. Most physical ailments stem from unnoticed emotional blocks.

**3. Your Personal HypnoTrack Program**
HypnoTrack audio programs specially prepared for you are recommended. These programs are matched to target exactly your subconscious patterns.

## WHY IS IT SO EFFECTIVE?

The method we use is based on **neuro-suggestive sound therapy**:

Calm and specially designed vocal suggestions bypass the conscious filter and reach the depths of the brain where automatic responses and emotional patterns are formed.

This allows:

- Stress patterns you weren't aware of to dissolve
- Negative beliefs you've carried for years to soften
- New, healthy neural connections to begin forming

## THE EPIGENETIC CONNECTION

Modern science has now proven: **Your thoughts affect your genes.**

Emotions, stress, and subconscious patterns directly influence how your genes are expressed — how they turn on and off.

Negative subconscious patterns → Chronic stress → Negative epigenetic changes

To break this cycle, you need to transform your subconscious patterns and lower your internal stress levels.

These changes prepare the ground for healthier epigenetic responses in your body.

## THE INSIDEX DIFFERENCE

INSIDEX is not just an app — it's a scientific way to communicate with your subconscious.

It is not a medical treatment, but it helps you optimize internal conditions that support your health from an epigenetic perspective.
